# FlyFast

This cookbook contains the full source code for FlyFast, utilizing both the [FlyFast-WebUI](https://github.com/riverbed/FlyFast-WebUI) and [FlyFast-FlightSearch](https://github.com/riverbed/FlyFast-FlightSearch) to demonstrates how works [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) with [Riverbed APM](https://www.riverbed.com/products/application-performance-monitoring/).

<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>

> The FlyFast demo app is instrumented with OpenTelemetry configured to send the OpenTelemetry traces to the [APM OpenTelemetry Collector](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector), which in turns exports traces to the Riverbed APM backend (whether APM SaaS or APM Analysis Server).
> In the app, both the WebUI frontend and the FlighSearch API backend are instrumented: the frontend instrumentation uses an experimental OpenTelemetry for Javascript in the browser, and the FlightSearch API uses OpenTelemetry for Python. 

</details>

## Prerequisites

1. an APM SaaS account, or an APM Analysis Server
2. *optional* an account for Aternity UJI
3. a Docker host, for example [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
4. git ([Git](https://git-scm.com/))

## Step 1. Get a local copy
    
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/riverbed/FlyFast.git --depth 1
```

## Step 2. Get your information for Riverbed APM

Open the APM web console and navigate to Agents > Install Agents (for example [https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com](https://apm.myaccount.aternity.com))

1. Grab the **Analysis Server Host**, for example *agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com*
2. Find your **CustomerID**, for example *12341234-12341234-13241234*

Those information are required to activate the [APM OpenTelemetry Collector](https://hub.docker.com/r/aternity/apm-collector) with an APM  account.
The CustomerID is not required when it is not an APM SaaS.

## Step 3. *optional* Get your information for Aternity UJI

<details>
  <summary>*optional* See details for Aternity UJI</summary>


1. Open [Aternity UJI](https://portals.bluetriangle.com) and navigate to Settings & Administration > Sites
2. Find the site configured for FlyFast and get the **UJI Tag Prefix**, for example *my-UJI-Tag-Prefix-FlyFast*

</details>

## Step 4. Start the containers

Start the containers using the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml), using the snipppet below
and replacing the values with the information collected at step 2. and step 3.

For example in Bash:

```bash
cd FlyFast

# Configure the APM OpenTelemetry Collector
export RIVERBED_APM_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
export RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

# Start the containers
docker compose up
```

or in PowerShell:

```PowerShell
cd FlyFast

# Configure the APM OpenTelemetry Collector
$env:RIVERBED_APM_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
$env:RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

# Start the containers
docker-compose up
```

<details>
  <summary>*optional* Add configuration for Aternity UJI</summary>

in Bash:

```bash
cd FlyFast

# Configure the APM OpenTelemetry Collector
export RIVERBED_APM_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
export RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

# Optional - Configure the Aternity UJI tag
# Replace "my-UJI-Tag-Prefix-FlyFast" with your UJI Tag Prefix collected at step 3.
export ALLUVIO_UJI_TAG='<script id=\"ALLUVIO-Aternity-UJI\" src=\"https:\/\/your-UJI-Tag-Prefix-FlyFast\.btttag\.com\/btt\.js\"><\/script>'

# Start the containers
docker compose up
```

or in PowerShell

```PowerShell
cd FlyFast

# Configure the APM OpenTelemetry Collector
# Replace the value with your information collected at step 2.
$env:RIVERBED_APM_SERVER_HOST="agents.apm.myaccount.aternity.com"
$env:RIVERBED_APM_CUSTOMER_ID="12341234-12341234-13241234"

# Optional - Configure the Aternity UJI tag
# Replace "your-UJI-Tag-Prefix-FlyFast" with your UJI Tag Prefix collected at step 3.
$env:ALLUVIO_UJI_TAG='<script id=\"ALLUVIO-Aternity-UJI\" src=\"https:\/\/your-UJI-Tag-Prefix-FlyFast\.btttag\.com\/btt\.js\"><\/script>'

# Start the containers
docker-compose up
```

</details>

## Step 5. Navigate through The Application And Monitor

The web application should now be available on [http://localhost](http://localhost).

Open the url in your browser and navigate through the application a few times to generate page views and transaction that will be monitored by APM.

## Step 6. Open Riverbed APM web console

Go to the APM web console to monitor the instance and observe every transaction.

### Stop The App and All The Containers

Press `CTRL + C` in the shell where it is running.

Or in a shell, go to the folder where you keep the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and run:

```shell
docker-compose stop
```

### Rebuild

```shell
docker compose build --no-cache
```

### Updating Based On Future Changes

Stay up to date with the latest changes.

```shell
git submodule update --remote
```
